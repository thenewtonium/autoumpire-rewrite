**Note:** This project is semi-abandoned as I have decided to focus my efforts on contributing to Henry Caushi's rewrite of autoumpire which can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/caushi-and-co/autoumpire-2) on GitLab.

# autoumpire-rewrite
 A rewritten version of the AutoUmpire software used by the Cambridge Assassin's Guild.
